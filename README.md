## Overview

The calalog project is a website and api that uses a database to present and
maintain an catalog of items which belong to different categories.

I've decided to use songs and music genres as the items and categories
respectively.

## Startup

Set the following environment variables.

```
FLASK_APP=songcat
FLASK_ENV=development
```
